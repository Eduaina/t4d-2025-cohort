## üìñ About
This program is a **4-phase learning journey** designed for complete beginners (with no prior coding knowledge).  
Over the course of the program, students will learn **JavaScript fundamentals**, move into **React with TypeScript**, and progressively build a **Community Productivity App** that integrates **AI features**.  

By the end, every student will have contributed to a **portfolio-ready application** and gained real-world experience working in teams.

### **Phase 2 ‚Äì React Basics**
- Focus: Getting started with **React**.  
- Goal: Learn components, props, state, and event handling.  
- Technologies: **React** (no Angular, React only).  
- Outcome: Ability to build simple UI applications.  

---

### **Phase 3 ‚Äì TypeScript + Applied React**
- Focus: Strengthen React apps with **TypeScript**.  
- Goal: Build stronger, more predictable apps while learning type safety.  
- Technologies: **React + TypeScript**.  
- Outcome: Students can create structured, type-safe apps with clean reusable components.

2. **Community Board (Posts)**  
3. **Task Management (Assign/Mark)**  
4. **AI Todo Suggestions**  
5. **Expense Tracking**  
6. **Notes Taking**  
7. **UI/Design & Accessibility**  
8. **Testing & Debugging**  
9. **Deployment & Documentation**
