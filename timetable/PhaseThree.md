# Phase 3 (Weeks 11–15, Nov): Frontend Framework (ReactJS)

🎯 Goals of Phase 3

* Understand the fundamentals of React (components, JSX, props, state, lifecycle).
* Learn to manage data and user interactions.
* Explore component-based UI design for scalability.
* Build a **Community Dashboard** that connects HTML/CSS/JS skills with React.
* Introduce best practices for project structuring and reusable components.

🛠 Mini Project: **Community Dashboard**

* A simple dashboard that displays members, posts, and tasks.
* Uses **localStorage** for persistence (simulating a backend).
* Acts as the **foundation for the capstone app** later (where AI + backend will be integrated).

✅ Deliverable for Phase 3
A functional **React-based Community Dashboard** where users can:

* Add/edit/remove “posts” or “tasks.”
* See updates rendered dynamically.
* Persist data locally (localStorage).
* Navigate across components (basic routing).

👉 By end of Phase 3:
They’ll have their **first real React app** (Community Dashboard), serving as the **foundation** of the final capstone app.
