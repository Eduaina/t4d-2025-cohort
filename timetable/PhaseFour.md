# Phase 4 (Weeks 16‚Äì20, Dec): TypeScript + Angular

üõ† **Mini Project**: Task & Team Management Module (TypeScript + Angular + API Integration)
This module plugs into the larger **AI-powered Community Productivity Web App**, introducing **robust typing**, **modular Angular architecture**, and **real-world API data** handling.

---

### üéØ Goals of Phase 4

* Understand **TypeScript fundamentals**: typing, interfaces, generics.
* Build scalable frontend apps using **Angular** (components, services, modules).
* Integrate **REST APIs** into Angular projects.
* Manage **state** and modularize code with Angular best practices.
* Apply AI for **Angular error debugging** and **TypeScript refactoring**.
* Deploy a **functional Task/Team Management system** (integrated later into the final capstone).

### ‚úÖ Deliverable for Phase 4

* **Task & Team Management Module** built in Angular + TypeScript.
* Features: CRUD tasks, assign tasks to teams, simple role-based display.
* Deployed and demoed as a **standalone app** that will later be **merged** into the final **AI-powered productivity app**.
